                    <p> At AssistHealth, we understand that the journey to recovery doesn't end when you leave the
                        hospital. That's why we
                        provide a valuable service exclusively for our registered members â€“ post-hospital care. Our
                        mission is to assist our
                        members in achieving a seamless transition from the hospital to the comfort of their own home
                        after their hospital stay.

                    <p> We recognize that once you're home, there can be confusion and uncertainty regarding treatment
                        plans and protocols. The
